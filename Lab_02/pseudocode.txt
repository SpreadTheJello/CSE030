array1:

include iostream + std
initialize variables: arr_size (int) and declare increasing to true (bool)
func(){
    ask user for size
    arr_size <- userinput
    
    error handle for incorrect arr_size < 0
    cont. if no error:

    ask user for numbers in array
    initialize arr[arr_size]

    loop through array size{
        check input by spaces and accept integers and input into array[i]
        check if its increasing by checking if number is less than the last number inputted, only if we're on 2nd loop
        print array
    }
    print if increasing
}

array2:

include iostream + std
initialize variables: str
func(){
    ask user for string to reverse
    str <- userinput
    for loop through length of string{
        output str from last index to first
    }
    new line
}
